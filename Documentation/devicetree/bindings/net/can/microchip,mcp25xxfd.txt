* Microchip MCP2517/18FD stand-alone CAN controller device tree bindings

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be one of the following:
   - "microchip,mcp2517fd" for MCP2517FD.
   - "microchip,mcp2518fd" for MCP2518FD.
   - "microchip,mcp25xxfd" to autodetect chip variant.
 - reg: SPI chip select.
 - clocks: The clock feeding the CAN controller.
 - interrupt-parent: The parent interrupt controller.
 - interrupts: Should contain IRQ line for the CAN controller.

Optional properties:
 - vdd-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN controller.
 - xceiver-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN transceiver.
 - rx-int-gpios: GPIO phandle of GPIO connected to to INT1 pin of the
   MCP25XXFD, which signals a pending RX interrupt.

Example:
	can0: can@0 {
		compatible = "microchip,mcp25xxfd";
		reg = <0>;
		clocks = <&can0_osc>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&can0_pins>;
		spi-max-frequency = <20000000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
		interrupts = <13 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		rx-int-gpios = <&gpio 27 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		vdd-supply = <&reg5v0>;
		xceiver-supply = <&reg5v0>;
	};
